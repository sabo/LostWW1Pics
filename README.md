# Intentionally Lost Pictures of the Great War ([@LostWW1Pics](https://twitter.com/LostWW1Pics))

## Description

### Conceptual:
This bot tweets photographs from a recently uncovered trove of World War One photographs.
Unfortunately, all of the photographs are generally poor.

### Actual:
This bot takes permissively-licensed pictures taken during World War One and then does one or a combination of:
* superimposing greyscale pictures of my fingers along the edges.
* applying a motion blur effect
* applying a random slight rotation

## Rationale

* I recently saw a talk by [Mimi Onuoha](http://mimionuoha.com/), an artist/researcher
    from NYC, that touched on the concept of working with missing datasets -- that is, 
    datasets that would be impossible to collect. Quoting from her personal page:
    > In a world mediated by computers, everything begins to look like data, and that which doesn't fit the mold is at risk of being forgotten.

* The day before I received the prompt for this project, I thought I had irreparably broken
    my phone while replacing its battery. It had been a while since my last backup, so I
    was a little bummed out at the prospect of losing all of the photos and messages that
    were only on that phone. But then I remembered that none of the photographs were very 
    good, since my awkward sausage fingers usually block part of the frame.

* I did not want to build a text-based twitter bot (been there done that).

* The idea to reconstruct missing or forgotten photographs kind of just popped out of
    that. I settled on using photos from World War One because, according to
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_photography#20th_century):
    > World War I was one of the first conflicts during which cameras were small enough to be carried on one's person.
    
    and, therefore, I've got to assume that for every striking photo of young men going
    over the top, there's a box stashed in some attic in Staten Island or whatever labeled
    "Grandpa's War Pix", full of poorly-lit, badly-framed, or otherwise low-quality
    pictures.
* I used a collection of very nice scans from an Atlantic series called [World War I in Photos](https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/world-war-i-in-photos/). They should all be public domain by now, but I also tweet the attribution used in that piece, along with a permalink to the original image, after each tweet.
